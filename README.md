# Water_Status_Check_Ternary
Water is a unique matter because it is the only natural substance that can exist in all three states of matter at the temperatures commonly found on Earth! Water is usually a liquid, but when it reaches 0° Celsius (C), it freezes into ice. (Ice is the solid-state of water.) When water reaches 100° C, it boils and becomes Gas. Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. Your program should determine the state of water at this temperature. (Find two solutions, one using conditional if statements, and the other with a single line Ternary (?) operator.)
